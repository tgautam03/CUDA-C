# Tiled Matrix Multiplication
## Problem Statement
### Inputs
- `A`: Input Matrix A of dimensions N1 x N2
- `B`: Input Matrix B of dimensions N2 x N3
- `C_cpu`: Matrix C of dimensions N1 x N3 computed on CPU
- `C_cpu`: Matrix C of dimensions N1 x N3 computed on GPU

### Operation
`c = A * B`

### Compilation and execution
To compile run `make` in the terminal. This creates an executable `mat_mul.out`.
