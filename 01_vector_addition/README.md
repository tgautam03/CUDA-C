# Vector Addition

## Problem Statement
### Inputs
- `N`: Vector length
- `A`: Vector A of length N
- `B`: Vector B of length N
- `C_cpu`: Output Vector C from CPU computation
- `C_gpu`: Output Vector C from CPU computation

### Operation
`C = A + B`

### Compilation and Execution
To compile run `make` in the terminal. This creates an executable `vec_add.out`.
